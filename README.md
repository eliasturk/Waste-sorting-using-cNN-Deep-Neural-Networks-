# Waste sorting using cNN Deep Neural Networks

## The model used for implementation on the laptop's webcam is Google's efficientnetv2 pre-trained model built in Transfer Learning.ipynb

### TrashNet dataset was used for this project and it can be found on github.

#### Note: This project contains 2 jupyter notebooks, one of them contains a cNN model from scratch and the other contains transfer learning using tf-hub. Proper citations have been mentioned in my project paper ,however,i reserve the right to not share it on GitHub.

Webcam Implementation scripts can be found under the names "sorting.py" and "sorting2.py" using the open-cv and cvzone libraries
